  "footer_content": "Glossary of terms of the Transaction Level Contract\nWhat is the Transaction Level Contract\nThe prevalent practice in e-commerce is for the e-commerce entity to enter into an agreement with each user and service provider(s), and then all transactions between the parties take place under the terms of that agreement. So as an example, a Buyer will agree to the Terms of Use of an online marketplace, the Seller will have been on-boarded onto this marketplace through a merchant on-boarding agreement, and service providers, such as delivery agents will have contracts with the marketplace or the Seller. Each transaction that takes place between the Buyer and Seller, as well as anyancillary transactions(e.g.: pick up and delivery), will take place under the terms of the aforementioned agreements.\nIn the ONDC Network, Buyer Apps and Seller Apps have no such pre-existing contractual relationship at the time of entering into a transaction. Furthermore, the Buyer has no privity of contract with the Seller App, and the Seller does not have privity of contract with the Buyer App. So, the terms and conditions of each transaction are codified through a digital contract that is created on-the-fly and digitally signed by transactingparties. This contract, executed using theONDC Protocol[1], contains two sets of terms: (i) the terms of sale between the Buyer and Seller, and (ii) the terms between Buyer App and Seller App for facilitating this sale. If the Seller App or Buyer App (Logistics Buyer) purchases logistics on the Network, the terms will be between the Logistics Buyer and the Logistics Service Provider (Logistics Seller), however, these terms will be part of a separate, linked order, with its own digital contract, with appropriate cross-reference.\nPurpose of this document\nMany critical parts of the contractual arrangement between the Network Participants that are part of a transaction are contained in the digital contract, whose structure is specified in ONDC’s API Specifications (which form one part of the ONDC Protocol). While the structure of the digital contract (i.e. the API Specifications) is human-readable in the strictest sense (in that it is a plain text file, and not machine code), a lay person may not be able to understand it without some assistance. The purpose of this document is to bridge that gap - i.e. to explain the contractual terms that the ONDC Protocol allows Network Participants to define in a systematic way. This document also explains how the Network Participants can utilise the API Specifications to construct contractual terms that they prefer, as well as, how to interpret terms received from another Network Participant.\nI.

To be interpreted in connection with the “type” field mentioned above.For example, let’s assume the value is set at “5”. If the “type” is set to “Amount”, that means the Buyer App Fee is INR 5. If the “type” is set to “percent”, it means the Buyer App Fee is 5% of the Total Order Value.Payment Collectorpayment.collected_byEither“BAP”, “BPP”If set to “BAP”, it means that the Buyer App will collect payment from the Buyer.If set to “BPP”, it means that the Seller App will collect payment from the Buyer.Payment Typepayment.typeEither“ON-ORDER”, “ON-FULFILLMENT”,“POST-FULFILLMENT”How payment is going to be collected from the Buyer. If this parameter is set to “ON-ORDER”, that means it is a pre-paid order, i.e. the payment is collected at the time of order confirmation. If this parameter is set to “ON-FULFILLMENT”, that means it is pay-on-delivery order, i.e. the payment is collected at the time of delivering the product to the Buyer.If this parameter is set to “POST-FULFILLMENT”, that means it is post the order delivery/service, i.e. the payment is collected post delivery of the product to the Buyer.Withholding Amount[a]payment.@ondc/org/withholding_amountEitherPositive Decimal NumberThe percentage of the total order value that the Payment Collector will withholdtill the return window expires.This amount will be settled if the return period is completed and the Buyer has not returned the product in that time.Explanation:This is typically most relevant where the order is pre-paid and the Buyer App is the Payment Collector. It is a mechanism to allow for easy refunds to the Buyer in case of a return.Settlement Basis[b]payment.@ondc/org/settlement_basisEither“return_window_expiry”, “shipment”, “delivery”The event that will trigger settlement from the Payment Collector to counterparty Network Participant(s).If it is set to “delivery”, that will mean settlement by the Payment Collector will be after completion of delivery.If it is set to “shipment”, that will mean settlement by the Payment Collector will be after the product is successfully shipped from the seller.If it is set to “return_window_expiry”, that will mean settlement by the Payment Collector will be on the expiry of the return window.Settlement Window[c]payment.@ondc/org/settlement_windowEitherTime period(ISO8601 format)The time period from completion of the Settlement Basis within which the Payment Collector will settle with counterparty Network Participant(s).As an example, if the Settlement Basis is set as “Delivery” and the Settlement Window is set to 7 days, and the Buyer App collects the payment, it means the Buyer App will remit funds to the Seller App on or before the completion of the 7th day after successful delivery, assuming the Buyer does not return the product within that time.ISO8601 duration notation is used to specify the value of the parameter.As an illustration, a Settlement Window of 5 days after delivery can be specified as “P5D” (i.e. period 5 days) or “PT120H” (i.e. period 120 hours).Settlement Amountpayment.@ondc/org/settlement_details.settlement_amountEitherPositive Decimal NumberThe amount that the Payment Collector will remit to the counterparty Network Participant for the instant transaction.For clarity, if the Buyer App is the Payment Collector, the Buyer App will deduct their fee from the Buyer Price and remit the balance to the Seller App. If the Seller App is the Payment Collector, they will remit the Buyer App’s fees from the Buyer Price, deduct its own charges/commission and remit the rest to the Seller. The settlement with the Logistics Service Provider will follow this same logic if either of the Network Participants procures on-network  logistics.Settlement Typepayment.@ondc/org/settlement_details.settlement_typeEither“neft”, “rtgs”, “upi”The Payment Collector will use the selected method to remit the due payment to the counterparty Network Participant.To illustrate,if the Buyer App collects the payment and the Settlement Type is set to “rtgs”, when the settlement is due, the Buyer App will transfer the Seller App’s share of the Buyer Price to the Seller App’s account via RTGS.Fulfillment Typefulfillments[].typeSeller App“Delivery”, “Self-Pickup”, “Return”This parameter describes how the order is going to be fulfilled. The parameter can be configured for both forward fulfilment (i.e. bringing the product from the seller to the buyer) as well as returns.If the parameter is set to “Delivery” that means the product will be delivered to the address provided by the Buyer.If the parameter is set to “Self-Pickup” that means the buyer must arrange to have the product picked up.If the parameter is set to “Return” that indicates that return has been initiated and the product will be picked up from the buyer.In forward fulfilment, this parameter will take the value “Delivery” or “Self-Pickup”, it can take the value “Return” only when the order is marked for return.Fulfillment TATfulfillments[].@ondc/org/TATEither (usually Seller App)Time period(ISO8601 format)[Can be a single value or a range]This is the turnaround time (TAT) for fulfilment. In the context of forward fulfilment (i.e. bringing the product from the seller to the buyer), if the Fulfillment Type is “Delivery”, the Fullfilment TAT describes the promisedtimewithin which the order will be delivered to the buyer from the time of confirmation of the order.If the Fulfillment Type is“Return”, the Fullfilment TAT describes the promised time within which an order marked for return will be delivered back to the seller after initiation of return.If a single value is provided it will mean that the order will be fulfilled before the expiry of the specified period. E.g.: If it is a single value configured as “P5D”, it means the the order will be delivered to the intended recipient (i.e. buyer in case of forward shipping, and seller in case of return) within 5 days from the time of confirmation (i.e. confirmation of order by Buyer or acceptance of return by Seller, as applicable)If a range is provided, it will mean that the order will be delivered between the specified period. E.g.: If it is configured as [“P5D”, “P10D”] the order will be delivered to the intended recipient after 5 days but before 10 days from the confirmation.Fulfillment Providerfulfillments[].@ondc/org/provider_nameEither (usually Seller App)String (name of the entity)This attribute contains the name of the entity that will deliver the order to the Buyer. This attribute is populated only when the Buyer App or Seller App purchases logistics through the ONDC Network, to fulfil the order in question.ItemReturnabilityitem.@ondc/org/returnableSeller Apptrue/ falseWhether the item in question is returnable as per the Seller.

The time period follows the ISO8601 duration notation.As an illustration, a return period of 5 days after delivery can be specified as “P5D” (i.e. period 5 days) or “PT120H” (i.e. period 120 hours).Item Cancellabilityitem.@ondc/org/cancellableSeller Apptrue/ falseWhether the order for that item can be cancelled after being confirmed. If set to “TRUE” that means the Seller allows the Buyer to cancel the order for the item in question, after confirmation.Limitation of Liabilityorder.tags.bpp_terms.max_liabilitySeller AppZero or Positive Decimal Numbermax_liabilityis the maximum aggregate liability of either party expressed as multiple of the total transaction value, while themax_liability_capis the maximum aggregate liability expressed in Indian Rupees (INR).To illustrate,if the value ofmax_liabilityis set to “2”, the total transaction value is INR 100, andmax_liability_capis empty,that will mean the aggregate liability of either party shall not be more than INR 200 (i.e. 2 multiplied by 100). If themax_liability_capis set as 100, and themax_liabilityis empty, that means the maximum aggregate liability will be INR 100.If both,max_liability_capandmax_liabilityareprovided, then the maximum aggregate liability will be the lower of the two amounts.To illustrate, if themax_liabilityis set to “2”, the total transaction value is INR 100, and themax_liability_capis set to 100. That will mean the maximum aggregate liability will be INR 100 (the lower of INR 200 and INR 100).If neithermax_liability_capnormax_liabilityare provided, i.e. both are empty, that would mean the contract does not have any clause related to limitation of liability. Effectively that would mean the liability is uncapped.Ifmax_liability_capandmax_liabilityare both set to 0 (zero), that would mean that both parties agree that neither of them will bear any liability.order.tags.bpp_terms.max_liability_capSeller AppZero or Positive Decimal NumberMandatory Arbitrationorder.tags.bpp_terms.mandatory_arbitrationSeller Apptrue/ falseIf this attribute is set to true, that would mean both parties agree that in case of a dispute, both parties must resolve the dispute througharbitration.Court Jurisdiction[d]order.tags.bpp_terms.court_jurisdictionSeller AppPick a city from a given list of cities which have a High Court benchThe name of the city whose courts will have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes related to this contract.

So if the Payment Collector delay was 50 days, the total interest payable would be INR 10 [calculated as 1000x(7.3/100)x(50/365)]Static Termsintent.tags.bap_terms.static_termsBuyer AppURLThis will be the URL of a web-page where the standard Terms and Conditions of the Network Participant - which are not covered in the API Specification (e.g.: indemnity) - will be hosted.

If set to “ON-FULFILLMENT” it means the payment is to be collected upon delivery.If this parameter is set to “POST-FULFILLMENT”, that means it is post completion of the service, i.e. the payment is collected post delivery of the product to the Buyer.[e]Settlement Windowpayment.@ondc/org/settlement_windowEitherTime period(ISO8601 format)The time period from completion of the Settlement Basis within which the Logistics Buyer will settle with the LSP.As an example, if the Settlement Window is set to 7 days, it means the Logistics Buyer will remit funds to the LSP on or before the completion of the 7th day after confirming the logistics order.ISO8601 duration notation is used to specify the value of the parameter.As an illustration, a Settlement Window of 5 days after delivery can be specified as “P5D” (i.e. period 5 days) or “PT120H” (i.e. period 120 hours).Settlement TypePayment.@ondc/org/settlement_details.settlement_typeEither“neft”, “rtgs”, “upi”The Logistics Buyer will use the selected method to remit the due payment to the LSP.To illustrate,if the Settlement Type is set to “rtgs”, when the settlement is due, the Logistics Buyer will transfer the LSP’s dues via RTGS.Fulfillment Typefulfillments[].typeLogistics Buyer\"Delivery\", \"Return\", \"RTO\"This parameter describes the broad type of the logistics order. The parameter can be used for both forward fulfilment (i.e. bringing the product from the seller to the buyer) as well as returns.If the parameter is set to “Delivery” that means the order is for forward shipping, i.e. from the Seller to the Buyer.If the parameter is set to “RTO” that means the LSP is returning the product to the Seller, due to a failure to complete the delivery.[2]If the parameter is set to “Return” that means the order is for a reverse pick-up, (i.e. pick-up from Buyer and delivery to Seller), due to a return being requested by the Buyer, and accepted by the Seller.For clarity, the reverse logistics order does not necessarily have to be placed by the same entity who purchased forward logistics, and neither does the LSP have to be the same as the LSP who did forward logistics.  It will be treated as a fresh logistics order.As an example, the forward logistics may have been purchased by the Seller App from LSP-X, while the reverse logistics may have been purchased by the Buyer App from LSP-Y.Declared valueorder.@ondc/org/linked_order.item.price.valueLogistics BuyerPositive Decimal NumberValue of the item as declared by the Logistics Buyer. This value is read from the linked order, i.e. the retail order for whose fulfillment the instant logistics order is being placed.

The exact TAT that corresponds to the Delivery Category will be provided through the Delivery TAT attribute.Delivery TATcategory.timeLSPTime period(ISO8601 format)This is the turnaround time (TAT) for delivery. In the context of forward logistics (i.e. bringing the product from the Seller to the Buyer), the Delivery TAT describes the maximum time within which the order will be delivered to the buyer from the time of confirmation of the order. In the case of reverse logistics (i.e. returning a product from the Buyer to the Seller), the Delivery TAT describes the maximum time within which the product will be returned to the Seller from initiation of the return.ISO8601 duration notation is used to specify the value of the parameter.As an illustration, a Settlement Window of 5 days after delivery can be specified as “P5D” (i.e. period 5 days) or “PT120H” (i.e. period 120 hours).Payload Weightfulfillment.@ondc/org/payload_details.weightLogistics BuyerPositive Decimal NumberWeight of the payload to be transported. The weight can be specified in grams or kilograms.Payload Dimensionsfulfillment.@ondc/org/payload_details.weightLogistics BuyerLength, Breadth and Height in Decimal NumberDimensions - i.e. length, breadth and height - of the payload to be transported.
