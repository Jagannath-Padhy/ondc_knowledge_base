Participants may validate the request & response payloads, based onmandatory attribute keys,as defined in this contract and respond with \"NACK\" (along with appropriate error code as definedhere) for invalid payloads.Any payload, without optional attribute keys, cannot be considered as invalid.\nAll participants are required to ensure full compliance with this API contract on the live ONDC network.\nSigning & Verification of requests & responses\nSigning & Verification of requests & responses\nKey pairs, for signing & encryption, can be generated using standard libraries such aslibsodium.\nCreating key pairs\nCreate key pairs, for signing (ed25519) & encryption (X25519);\nUpdate base64 encoded public keys in registry;\nUtility to generate signing key pairs and test signing & verification ishere;\nAuth Header Signing\nGenerate UTF-8 byte array from json payload;\nGenerate Blake2b hash from UTF-8 byte array;\nCreate base64 encoding of Blake2b hash, this becomes the digest for signing;\nSign the request, using your private signing key, and add the signature to the request authorization header, following steps documentedhere;\nAuth Header Verification\nExtract the digest from the encoded signature in the request;\nGet the signing_public_key from registry using lookup (by using the ukId in the authorization header);\nCreate (UTF-8) byte array from theraw payloadand generate Blake2b hash;\nCompare generated Blake2b hash with the decoded digest from the signature in the request;\nIn case of failure to verify, HTTP error 401 should be thrown;\nRegistry lookup for verifying requests\nRegistry lookup for verifying requests\nThere are 2 possible participant types, for logistics domain, in the ONDC registry:\nBuyer NP\nSeller NP\nEach participant type, defined above, will have an entry in the registry for their entity. Every participant on the ONDC registry will have 1 or more entries in the registry, with \"ukid[a]\" for each such entry;\nSigning & Verification of requests and responses using auth headers is definedhere;\nAll requests & responses have to be signed by the sender and verified by the receiver. If any request fails verification, it should be rejected (NACK) with http 401 error code;\nThe identity of the sender of a request is sent, through the auth header, as follows:\nkeyId=\"{subscriber_id}|{unique_key_id}|{algorithm[b]}\"\nSigning by Buyer App & Seller App will be using their private key, for which the corresponding public key will be in the registry for their \"ukid\";\nVerification of requests using registry /lookup usesthisAPI spec.Participants can either use the registry lookup endpoints fromhereor cache the registry locally (with refresh at regular interval) for a local lookup.Following options are available:\n/lookup\nrequest:\n{\n\"subscriber_id\":\"lsp.com\",\n\"domain\":\"nic2004:60232\",\n\"ukId\":\"UKID1\",\n\"country[1]\":\"IND\",\n\"city[2]\":\"std:080\",\n\"type[3]\":\"BPP\"\n}\nresponse:\n(will

of APIs &transaction trail\nConstruct of APIs &transaction trail\nAll APIs follow the same construct and include:\nContext- includes transaction_id, message_id and other attribute keys that identify the source & destination of the message being sent through the API request or response;\nMessage- identifies the content of the message e.g. the search intent, catalog details, order details, etc.;\nAll APIs are asynchronous, i.e.:\nrequest is sent from sender to recipient;\nrecipient acknowledges the request by sending an \"ACK\" or sends \"NACK\" if the recipient cannot validate the request;\nrecipient sends response through the callback for the corresponding request API e.g. /on_search callback for /search request;\nrecipient of callback (could be the original sender) acknowledges the response by sending an \"ACK\" or \"NACK\" if the recipient cannot validate the request;\nEvery request & response pair is identified by a transaction_id + unique message_id & the sender of a request is able to correlate the response to the request using the above;\nIf a stale request or response is received, i.e. with timestamp earlier than similar request or response (identified by the transaction_id + message_id) that has already been processed, the recipient can send \"NACK\" with the error code \"65003\";\nError block can be sent in sync (in response to request) or async (along with callback) mode and should have the following attribute keys: error.type, error.code;\nONDC standard error codes are definedhere;\nTransaction trail for a buyer is maintained through a unique transaction_id for the pre-order stage, i.e. /search, /select, /init, /confirm;\nUnique id for an order on a network will be identified by the transaction_id & order

with a quote;\nRetail Seller NP uses this to compute an order-to-delivery (O2D) TAT as follows: ship-to-delivery (S2D) + order-to-ship (O2S) + average time to pickup (proposed above);\nS2D TAT will also be a part of the order in /confirm and /on_confirm;\nWhen there is an O2D breach, the retail buyer NP / seller NP may initiate cancellation of the retail order / fulfillment which will cascade into cancellation of the logistics order;\nLiabilities in case of O2D breach will be defined in the terms & conditions;\nRTO flow\nEvery fulfillment will have an identifier for whether RTO results in actual return to origin;\nCodifying reverse QC SOP\nReverse QC SOP is in the form of an online checklist, with or without instructions, and provided by Seller NP;\nLogistics agent updates the online checklist with status of inspection of return items;\nSample checklist is includedhereand this should preferably include instructions on whether a item (for return) can be picked up or not;\nChanging

(RTO flow)\nRTO will be initiated when the end buyer does not accept or cannot be located for the order / fulfillment to be delivered;\nIn case of RTO:\nEvery fulfillment will have an identifier for whether RTO results in actual return to origin (in /confirm);\nRTO, with return, will result in package being returned to the point of pickup for now (will be amended to allow merchant to provide return location which may be different from point of pickup);\nBuyers are within their rights to RTO, if the fulfillment is delivered beyond the fulfillment TAT, thus constituting a TAT breach;\nIn the event of RTO, without anybreach of TAT, the Logistics Buyer NP may recover both the forward shipping cost as well as RTO costs from the retail buyer NP. In this case, the LSP may be expected to help establish that the retail buyer refused to accept or was not available / couldn’t be contacted to accept delivery;\nRTO process flow is as follows:\nLSP tries to deliver the order to the retail buyer (it is assumed that a certain number of retries are built in for all deliveries except immediate delivery). Typical number of retries is 3 as per industry standard;\nRetail buyer does not accept the order or is unreachable / unavailable at the mentioned shipping address on attempt to deliver the order (LSP may be expected to help substantiate that reasonable attempt was made to connect and deliver the order to the retail buyer at the specified address);\nLSP initiates cancellation of logistics order, through /on_cancel, and provides specific reason code as defined, forhyperlocal&inter-city, and AWB no (for forward shipment, if applicable);\n/on_cancel with reason code (that triggers RTO as defined in the reason codes) will initiate RTO and result in the following:\naddition of new fulfillment record for the logistics order, with fulfillment start location / time, fulfillment state set to \"RTO-Initiated\";\nquote for RTO will be added to the original quote (for forward shipment), matching the quote provided in logistics /on_search;\norder state will be set to \"Cancelled\";\nIf the RTO request is valid (as determined by the reason code and above info provided), the logistics buyer NP has to accept the request. If LSP sends a different quote, from what was sent in /on_search, the logistics buyer NP may reject the RTO request (with NACK and error code62503[gs][gt][gu]) and the RTO request has to be resent with the correct quote;\n/on_cancel will also result in cascaded retail /on_cancel request, for the fulfillment, and include the new fulfillment record for RTO, fulfillment start location / time, fulfillment state, order state and quote for RTO (if retail buyer has to pay for the RTO cost as per the cancellation reason code);\nAfter RTO delivery is completed, LSP updates fulfillment status for RTO fulfillment to \"RTO-Delivered\", fulfillment end time, etc. through /on_status and this is cascaded to the retail order;\nIn case of RTO without return, fulfillment state will be updated to \"RTO-Disposed\";\n{\n\"context\":\n{\n\"domain\":\"nic2004:60232\",\n\"country\":\"IND\",\n\"city\":\"std:080\",\n\"action\":\"on_cancel\",\n\"core_version\":\"1.2.0\",\n\"bap_id\":\"logistics_buyer.com\",\n\"bap_uri\":\"https://logistics_buyer.com/ondc\",\n\"bpp_id\":\"lsp.com\",\n\"bpp_uri\":\"https://lsp.com/ondc\",\n\"transaction_id\":\"T1\",\n\"message_id\":\"M5\",\n\"timestamp\":\"2023-06-06T23:00:30.000Z\"\n},\n\"message\":\n{\n\"order\":\n{\n\"id\":\"O2\",\n\"state\":\"Cancelled[gv][gw]\",\n\"cancellation\":\n{\n\"cancelled_by\":\"lsp.com\",\n\"reason\":\n{\n\"id\":\"013\"\n}\n},\n\"provider\":\n{\n\"id\":\"P1\",\n\"locations\":\n[\n{\n\"id\":\"L1\"\n}\n]\n},\n\"items\":\n[\n{\n\"id\":\"I1\",\n\"fulfillment_id\":\"1\",\n\"category_id\":\"Same

transaction level contract  between the participating NPs is explainedhereand includes the standard terms & conditions for the network participant(s);\nThe codified digital contract includes a set of configurable terms defined by the seller and a set of static terms which will be defined by the LSP;\nA reference to these static terms will be a part of every online transaction between 2 participants;\nReference clauses to serve as a guide for participants to draft their static terms for the codified digital contract can be foundhere;\nProposed flow\nStatic terms will be version-controlled in GitHubrepo:\nAll static terms will start with version 1.0.0 and subsequent changes will increment the version;\nNP creates a PR for their static terms and ONDC will merge this PR and share the link with the NP:\nNP forks the repository and creates a branch under the appropriate version, using the following naming convention:\n<NP name>_role e.g. \"Loadshare_LSP\", \"Shadowfax_LSP\", etc.;\nrole can have following values - \"LSP\" (logistics service provider);\nNP merges their static terms into this branch;\nNP creates PR for these changes;\nStatic terms can be published by NP on multiple channels e.g. their website, ONDC portal, etc.\nCommunication & acceptance of static terms:\nCommunication by LSP\nLSP sends the following additional info as part of /on_search:\ncurrentstatic terms link with version:\nfor the very 1st static terms, this will be a blank link;\nnewstatic terms link with version:\nfor the very 1st static terms, this will be the link for static terms in GitHub;\neffective date for new static terms;\nInfo in (i) above will be sent in /on_search for full catalog pull for 24 hrs, after this version of static terms is published;\n24 hrs prior to expiry of effective date in (i) above, LSP resends additional info in (i) above;\nIf LSP wants to change the effective date, they can update the effective date in (i) above and repeat (ii) & (iii);\nIf LSP wants to change their static terms, they need to resubmit their PR with new version no;\nIt is recommended that the LSP should give at least 15 days of advance notice when they are changing their static terms;\nAcceptance by logistics buyer NP (BNP)\nIf BNP accepts the static terms in /on_search, they need to sendaccept=\"Y\" in ACK for /on_search;\nIf BNP doesn’t accept the static terms in /on_search, they need to sendaccept=\"N\" in ACK for /on_search;\nIf BNP doesn’t accept the static terms for a LSP, they should stop sending order requests to the LSP;\nStatic terms agreed to between the BNP & LSP will be a part of /confirm and /on_confirm;\n[1]optional\n[2]optional\n[3]optional, enum - \"BPP\", \"BAP\", \"BG\"\n[4]subscriber id of request initiator\n[5]unique
