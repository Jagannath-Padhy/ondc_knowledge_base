Overview\nThe objective of this note is to propose a payment & settlement protocol for initiating discussion with the ONDC community. ONDC will support a diverse set of Buyer App and Seller App entities, in different domains, each of whom may have their own policies for payment collection by themselves and for settlement with the counterparty. This note proposes a way for different parties, to a transaction, to mutually negotiate their payment & settlement terms & conditions that leads to a deterministic outcome for the order transaction.\nPayment collection could be at either of these points:\nBuyer App\nSeller App\nLogistics Agent - only for Cash on Delivery (COD)\nEvery transaction in ONDC will be a bilateral transaction between a Buyer App and Seller App. Payment & Settlement, between different participating entities, will happen using existing payment technology (e.g. payment gateway, UPI, wallets, etc.) and will be outside the network. However, the terms & conditions, for such Payment & Settlement, and the promise or proof of payment will be transmitted using the underlying protocol.\nFor the 1st two collection points defined above, there are 4 possible scenarios for payment collection in ONDC:\n[a]\nFigure 1\nCollection Flexibility: Possible Scenarios\nONDC will allow collection flexibility, i.e. allow the Buyer App or Seller App to decide whether to collect payment for an order, as per their collection policies, and have it acceptable to the counterparty. This can include the following scenarios:\nBuyer App asserts its right to collect payment, optionally through the search intent but also during Order initialization. This has to be accepted by the Seller App during Order initialization, irrespective of whether they honoured the assertion during the search intent;\nBuyer App doesn’t assert its right to collect payment, optionally through the search intent but also during order initialization. This has to be accepted by the Seller App, by agreeing to collect payment, during Order initialization, irrespective of whether they honoured the lack of assertion, by the Buyer App, during the search intent by implicitly agreeing to collect payment through their display of the Catalogue;\nWhile scenarios 1 & 3 above result in agreement between the Buyer App & Seller App, regarding payment collection, scenarios 2 & 4 above result in lack of agreement and the Order transaction failure prior to confirmation. “Who collects payment” is one of the parameters that will be negotiated between the counterparties to the transaction and the other parameters are defined later in this note. In order to ensure a deterministic outcome for this type of negotiation, anegotiation[b]protocolis proposed.\nPayment & Settlement in ONDC will be guided by ONDC network policies which will evolve in consultation with the participant community. Payment & Settlement in ONDC will be guided by the following network policies:\nParticipants in the ONDC networkwill not need to enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements, with other participants, for settlement. Instead, all participants need to adhere to a Network Level Agreement with ONDC that among others will also define the payment & settlement terms, which includes payment & settlement outside the network through the mutual negotiation & transmission of these terms, alongwith the proof or promise of payment, between participants;\nWhoever collects the payment (i.e. Buyer app or Seller app) could optionally maintain a refund pool, using the withholding amount from a transaction, which could be used to settle refunds in cases of returns, damaged items, etc, and that is withheld until the return window closes;\nIt is also possible that Buyer App and Seller App mutually agree to settle for a delivered orderafter expiry of the return window. In this case, neither the Buyer App nor the Seller App shall be required to maintain a refund pool created from withholding amount and will also eliminate the need for reconciliation of withholding amount and its adjustment;\n2. Role of participants in a transaction\nThe table below lists the different participants in a transaction, covering all possible payment & settlement scenarios, and hence could be involved in the payment & settlement process. Every participant in the payment & settlement process may not be a ONDC network participant (all such participants who are also ONDC network participants are colour-coded).\nThe key participants in a transaction are:\nBuyer- orders items using Buyer App;\nBuyer App- entity that provides the Buyer Application, using which the buyer can purchase items using ONDC;\nSeller App- entity that provides the Seller Application which is a storefront for the sellers, for publishing their catalogue and processing & fulfilling orders;\nSeller-  any merchant or store that maintains items and processes & fulfils orders for these items through a Seller App;\nParticipant TypesBuyerBuyer AppSeller AppSellerLogistics Agent - only for Cash on Delivery (CoD)BuyerNA1.

Possible use of Refund Pool\nThe refund pool, maintained by the Buyer App or Seller App, using the withholding amount, could be used for quick settlement with the buyer, for the following:\nRefund in case of part or full return;\nRefund in case the buyer receives items (e.g. perfume) in a damaged or broken state[c];\n4. Commercial Components of Order\nThe commercial components of an order shall include the details below.All numbers shown below, for the components, are hypothetical and only for the purpose of illustration and nothing else.\nDeclared Price(per item) - this is the price declared by the seller-on-record or merchant and shown on the Buyer App catalog and may or may not be inclusive of GST;\nTotal Order Value-this is the final price, payable by a buyer and is computed by the seller, with the following components:\nDeclared Price: Price declared by the provider;\nConvenience Charge - Seller / Seller Marketplace may use this line to recover any costs or charges that it might like to recover from the buyer. Recovering buyer finder fee or seller app fee from the buyer by including it in convenience charge is at the discretion of the seller / seller app (see note below). Sellers may choose not to recover the buyer finder fee from the buyer in the convenience fee and absorb it like other costs;\nDelivery Charges:  Seller Marketplace may send delivery charges equal to or lower than or higher than the actual or quoted logistics cost;\nPackaging Charges: Charges that seller / seller marketplace may choose to recover;\nTaxes: GST on each of the above lines is expected to be included ineach of the quotes for the line[d]itself. For eg the item price of mobile phone of Rs.10,000 includes GST of Rs. 1,525. Only exception as of now is GST collected by ECO (ecommerce operator) in case of online food delivery and online cab bookings presently @ of 5% on the item price.\nTotal order value (Quote)=Σ(list price for items + service charges for logistics / packing / convenience fees + taxes) + buyer app fee (applied as % of AOV) which is the same as Σ(list price for items + buyer app fee as % of list price) + Σ(service charges + buyer app fee as % of service charges) + taxes applied to declared price for item + services;\nFinal Product consideration due to the seller-on-record is (list price for the seller - TCS if any);[e]\nScenario[f][g]\nList price of item = ₹100 (includes seller app fee if any, seller app calculations are off network under this calculation and therefore principle of double taxation is handled there)\nDelivery charges[1]= ₹50 (exclusive of taxes)\nBuyer finder fee (BFF)[2]= 5% of total order value (doesn’t include GST)\nGST for BFF = 18%\nGST for product = 5%\nGST for delivery charges = 5%\nHow BFF is applied?\nBuyer App sends search request with finder fee =5.9%(includes BFF+GST, i.e.5% + 18% of 5%)\nSeller app calculates & sends declared price for item =₹100 + 5.9% of ₹100 (BFF)\nDeclared price on catalog= ₹105.90\nIncludes BFF of ₹5 + GST on BFF of ₹0.90\nSeller app calculates & sends declared price for delivery charge =₹50 + 5.9% of ₹50\nDeclared price for delivery charge = ₹52.95\nIncludes BFF of ₹2.5 + GST on BFF of ₹0.45\nSeller app calculates tax on item & sends in quote = 5% of ₹100= ₹5\nSeller app calculates tax on delivery charge & sends in quote = 5% of ₹50= ₹2.5\nTotal order value =₹105.90 + ₹52.95 + ₹5 + ₹2.5 = ₹166.35\nBFF should be applied on₹100 + ₹50 = ₹150.0[h]\nPayment & Settlement (excluding TDS, TCS)\nBuyer pays -₹166.35\nBFF (including GST) = 5.9% of₹150.0 = ₹8.85\nSeller App receives =₹166.35 - ₹8.85 = ₹157.50\nSeller App pays LSP =₹52.5\nMerchant receives =₹157.50 - ₹52.5 = ₹105.0\nExceptions\nIf adding the BFF to the declared price for an item causes it to exceed the MRP, the BFF (for the item) can be sent as convenience charge as per the API contract;[i]\nBFF, of fixed amount, can be added to the item or delivery charges or split between these charges at the discretion of the seller app;\nSummary\nThe quote for an order will be the cumulative value of the Declared Price for individual items in the Order, price for logistics services and markup / discounts provided by the Buyer App;\nAdditional charges such as for logistics services (whether imposed  by Seller App or Buyer App), markups or discounts offered by Buyer App, etc. will be separate line items in the Order;\nThe cost for logistics services will be included in the quote for the Order, through the seller app or buyer app, based on how it was procured. In this case, the payment for logistics services will be initiated by the Seller App or Buyer App that procured such services;\nInvoice will be generated by the seller-on-record and made available to the buyer as part of the protocol;\n5. Terms & Conditions\nPayment & Settlement terms & conditions will be decided as part of the Order lifecycle. Some of these terms & conditions will be fixed by one or more parties to the transaction. Other terms & conditions will be mutually negotiated between the parties to the transaction.\nFixed terms & conditions\nTerms & ConditionsFixed byMandatory?Default valueDefinitionProtocol ReferenceBuyer AppFinder FeeBuyer App (as part of Search Intent)No0Finder fee for the Buyer App as a % of the total order value or a fixed amount per orderAPI/search;SchemaIntent.payment.”./ondc-buyer_app_finder_fee_type”Intent.payment.”./ondc-buyer_app_finder_fee_amount”Settlement Start TimeBased on type of paymentNoFor prepaid - timestamp of payment transaction reference; for CoD - timestamp of deliveryForprepaid, based on settlement basis  - collection (timestamp of payment transaction reference), shipment or delivery;Forcash-on-delivery, settlement start time is triggered on delivery.Schema- for:Collection - order.payment.time.timestampShipment -order.fulfillment.start.time.timestampDelivery -order.fulfilment.end.time.timestamp\nTerms & Conditions\nFixed by\nMandatory?\nDefault value\nDefinition\nProtocol Reference\nBuyer AppFinder Fee\nBuyer App (as part of Search Intent)\nNo\n0\nFinder fee for the Buyer App as a % of the total order value or a fixed amount per order\nAPI\n/search;\nSchema\nIntent.payment.”./ondc-buyer_app_finder_fee_type”\nIntent.payment.”./ondc-buyer_app_finder_fee_amount”\nSettlement Start Time\nBased on type of payment\nNo\nFor prepaid - timestamp of payment transaction reference; for CoD - timestamp of delivery\nForprepaid, based on settlement basis  - collection (timestamp of payment transaction reference), shipment or delivery;\nForcash-on-delivery, settlement start time is triggered on delivery.\nSchema- for:\nCollection - order.payment.time.timestamp\nShipment -\norder.fulfillment.start.time.timestamp\nDelivery -\norder.fulfilment.end.time.timestamp\nNegotiable terms & conditions\nTerms & conditions for payment & settlement, that will be mutually negotiated between the participants, as part of the transaction, include:\nTerms & ConditionsDefinitionMandatory?Default ValueWhen negotiatedProtocol ReferenceWho collects payment?Who collects the payment - buyer app, seller app (logistics agent always collects for cash on delivery)YesN/Aa.

Payment & Settlement Process Flow\nThis section elaborates the process flows for Payment & Settlement, for an order, along with appropriate examples, for different scenarios, in ONDC:\nScenario 1 - Buyer App collect payments, Seller App agrees\nThe process flow for payment & settlement will be as follows for a Buyer App and a single Seller App. In case of multiple Seller Apps, the same process will be repeated for each Seller App.\nBuyer App asserts the right tocollect paymentfor the Order. Buyer App asserts this right, by also specifying thewithholding amountas a % of cumulative declared price,settlement basis,settlement windowandreturn window;\nSeller App agrees to Buyer App asserting to collect payment.\nSeller App & Buyer App can mutually negotiate on the other terms & conditions (withholding amount, settlement basis, settlement window, return window[n][o])and come to an agreement. When there is agreement, Seller App specifies its settlement mechanism;\nBuyer App collects payment from Buyer and settles with Seller App as per its settlement terms & conditions, after deducting the withholding amount. In case logistics services were procured through the Buyer App, the Buyer App also settles with the logistics provider, based on its settlement terms & conditions;\nIn case logistics services were procured through the Seller App, the Seller App settles with the logistics provider based on its settlement terms & conditions;\nAfter thereturn windowcloses, Buyer App transfers the withholding amount to Seller App as per its settlement terms & conditions in case of no returns (settlement window will be applied from the day after closure of return window);\nFigure 2\nProcess Flow: Payment Collection by Buyer App\nExample\nBuyer purchases 10 kg of Atta through a Buyer App and declared price for this item by a Seller App is ₹630. Buyer App has a fixed finder fee of 5%, included in the declared price. Seller App also provides free delivery through logistics provider;\nDuring confirmation of order, buyer app & seller app negotiate the payment & settlement terms & conditions as follows (assume settlement start time is 21st Mar 2022):\nBuyer App & Seller App mutually negotiate and agree on the following -withholding amountof 10%,settlement windowof 2 days,return windowof 7 days;\nSeller App provides itssettlement details(payee bank account no);\nBuyer App collects ₹630 from buyer;\nBuyer App deductswithholding amountof ₹63, itsfinder feeof ₹31.5[p]and pays Seller App ₹535.5 by 23rd Mar 2022;\nBuyer App transfers withholding amount of ₹63 to Seller App by 30th Mar 2022 (on closure of return window on 28th Mar, assuming no returns);\nScenario 2 - Seller App collects payment\nThe process flow for payment & settlement will be as follows for a Buyer App and a single Seller App. In case of multiple Seller Apps, the same process will be repeated for each Seller App.\nBuyer App refuses to assert first right to collect payment and Seller App agrees to collect payment;\nSeller App & Buyer App mutually negotiate & agree on the following -withholding amountof 10%,settlement windowof 2 days,return windowof 7 days.\nBuyer App provides its settlement details (payee bank account no);\nSeller App collects payment from Buyer and settles with Buyer App, itsFinder Fee, as per the mutually agreed settlement terms & conditions.In case logistics services were procured through the Buyer App, the Seller App also includes the cost of logistics services;\nIn case logistics services were procured through the Seller App, the Seller App settles with the logistics provider based on its settlement terms & conditions;\nFigure 3\nProcess Flow: Payment Collection by Seller App\nExample\nBuyer purchases 5 kg of Atta through a Buyer App and declared value for this item by a Seller App is ₹315. Buyer App has a fixed finder fee of 5%, included in the declared price. Seller App also provides home delivery through a logistics provider which charges fees of ₹30. Hence, total order value is ₹315 + ₹30 = ₹345;\nDuring confirmation of order, buyer app & seller app negotiate the payment & settlement terms & conditions as follows (assume settlement start time is 21st Mar 2022):\nBuyer App refuses to assert right to collect payment and Seller App agrees to collect payment;\nSeller App & Buyer App mutually negotiate & agree on the following -settlement windowof 2 days;\nBuyer App provides its settlement details (payee bank account no);\nSeller App collects ₹345 from buyer;\nSeller App pays Buyer App ₹15 (Finder fee) by 23rd Mar 2022;\nSeller App pays Logistics Provider ₹30 as per their settlement terms & conditions;\nSettlement of withholding amount will be between the Seller App and the Seller;\nCash on delivery payment\nCash on delivery payment can happen only when there is a match between the payment modes offered by the buyer and the modes of collection by the Logistics Agent, e.g. buyer offers payment in Cash or UPI and Logistics Agent accepts these modes of payment collection. In this case, the cash on delivery payment will happen and the order fulfilment is completed.\nIn case there is a mismatch in the payment modes offered by the buyer and the modes of collection by the Logistics Agent,e.g. buyer offers payment in credit card and Logistics Agent accepts cash or UPI only, it will be up to the Logistics Provider[q][r][s][t]to decide whether to cancel the order and perform a return to origin (RTO).\nThe process flow for payment & settlement will be as follows for a Buyer App, a single Seller App and a single Logistics Provider. In case of multiple Seller Apps, it is assumed the order will be fulfilled by the same or different logistics providers, but the order through a Seller App will be fulfilled by a single logistics provider. Hence, in the case of multiple Seller Apps with a single or multiple logistics providers, the same process will be repeated for each Logistics Provider.\nAs part of the order confirmation process, Buyer App and Seller App will mutually negotiate and agree to the following terms & conditions -withholding amount&return window(in case logistics services procured by Buyer App),settlement window. Additionally, the logistics provider would have negotiated their settlement terms & conditions with the Seller App or Buyer App, through which their services was procured;\nLogistics Agent collects payment from Buyer and settles with Logistics Provider (as per their terms & conditions). Settlement start time, with Seller App and Buyer App, is from the delivery of order;\nIf logistics services were procured through the Seller App:\nLogistics Provider settles with Seller App, after deducting their charges from the collected amount, as per their settlement terms & conditions;\nSeller App settles with the Buyer App as per its settlement terms & conditions (i.e.Finder fee);\nIf logistics services were procured through the Buyer App:\nLogistics Provider settles with Buyer App, after deducting their charges from the collected amount, as per their settlement terms & conditions;\nBuyer App settles with the Seller App as per its settlement terms & conditions, after deducting itsFinder feeandwithholding amount;\nAfter thereturn windowcloses, Buyer App transfers thewithholding amountto Seller App as per its settlement terms & conditions (settlement window will be applied from the day after closure of return window);\nFigure 4\nProcess Flow: Cash on Delivery Payment\nExample\nBuyer purchases 5 kg of Atta through a Buyer App and declared value for this item by a Seller App is ₹420. Buyer App has a fixed finder fee of 5%, included in the declared price. Seller App also provides home delivery through a logistics provider which charges fees of ₹30. Hence, total order value is ₹420 + ₹30 = ₹450;\nDuring confirmation of order, buyer app & seller app negotiate the payment & settlement terms & conditions as follows (assume settlement start time starts on 21st Mar 2022):\nBuyer App & Seller App mutually negotiate and agree on the following -settlement windowof 3 days;\nBuyer App provides its settlement details (payee bank account no);\nSeller App agrees to settlement window of 1 day with Logistics Provider and specifies its payee account details;\nLogistics Agent collects ₹450 from buyer and settles with their Logistics Provider;\nLogistics Provider pays Seller App ₹420(after deducting their charges of ₹30) by 22nd Mar;\nSeller App pays Buyer App its Finder fee of ₹20 by 24th Mar;\nSettlement of Withholding Amount will be between the Seller App and the Seller;\nRefunds\nRefunds in cases of returns, cancellations,damaged[u][v][w]items, etc. will be as follows:\ni.Cancellation- refund will be initiated as follows:\nPrepaid order -[x]by the entity that collected the payment from the buyer (i.e. buyer app or seller app) and the refund money flow will be the exact reverse of the payment money flow;\nCoD order - since cancellation happens before delivery, no payment would be made and hence, there is no refund;\nii.Return- refund will be initiated as follows:\nPrepaid order - by the entity that collected the payment from the buyer (and has the withholding amount) and the refund money flow will be the exact reverse of the payment money flow;\nCoD order - by the entity that has the withholding amount (i.e. Seller App or Buyer App), and will be the same as the entity that procured the services of the Logistics Provider. If the Seller App initiates the refund,it will transfer the amount to the Buyer App[y]and therefund will be in the form of credit to the buyer account. If the Buyer App initiates the refund, it willcredit the buyer account;\niii.Damaged Items- refund money flow will be the same as Return.\n7. Technical details for Payment and Settlement\nPayment & Settlement terms will be communicated using the Payment object.
